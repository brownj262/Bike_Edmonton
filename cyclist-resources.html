 		<div><h2>Biking in the City</h2></div>

 		<div><h4>Locking your Bike</h4></div>

 		<div>
	 		<p>Please remember that registering your serial number doesn’t prevent bike theft, but good locking technique can. Always keep your bike locked when you’re not physically with it: especially at home.</p>

	 		<p>Use a U-lock, folding lock, or a heavy-duty security bicycle or motorbike chain (with hardened-steel links at least 10mm thick) with a heavy duty lock (a normal padlock is easy to cut), or use a U-lock in combination with a cable lock.</p>

	 		<p>Do not use just a cable lock or chain from a hardware store: hand-held cutters will cut through most cheap cable locks, and even very expensive cable locks can be cut more easily than a good U-lock. Thicker cable locks may just take 3 snips instead of 1 snip: they’re not enough to protect your bike.</p>

	 		<p>Better locks will have independent ratings (Sold Secure and/or ART): aim for at least Sold Secure Silver/ART 2 for medium security, but Sold Secure Gold or ART 3+ for higher-value bikes or locking outdoors, especially in less secure areas or for longer periods (more than a few minutes). Cable locks, no matter how expensive, never achieve those ratings, as, while they’re convenient, they’re also inherently weak. A $50 cable lock is guaranteed to be less secure than a $30 U-lock. Bronze ratings indicate a weak lock; no ratings mean the manufacturer hasn’t had their lock tested.</p>

	 		<p>Most bikes are stolen from backyards, parkades, and out of garages or sheds. Some are even stolen from second-floor balconies. When your bike is at home, keep it locked, and out of view from potential thieves.
	 		If your bike has a quick-release seat, either always take your seat with you (even at home), or change it to use an allen bolt.</p>

	 		<p>If your bike has quick-release wheels, make sure that they are also locked up. Use your U-lock so that it passes through the frame and one your wheels (or both, if you take one wheel off). A bike with no wheels isn’t much better than a stolen bike.</p>

	 		<p>Non-quick-release components can still be stolen relatively easily if left unlocked, but are slightly less likely to be stolen as quickly.</p>

	 		<p>Always lock to something secure. If you lock to a branch, a post that isn’t bolted properly to the ground, a broken or unsecured bike rack, or to something that a thief can lift the lock over, the thief won’t have to break your lock to steal your bike.</p>

	 		<p>Take with you any easily-removed accessories and components such as lights, seat bags, and quick-release seat.</p>

	 		<p>To reduce the risk of becoming a target, never tempt thieves by leaving your bicycle locked for long periods such as overnight, or securing it in a predictable fashion, such as putting it in the same bicycle rack every day.
			Mark your bicycle so that you can easily prove it’s yours, and take photos. Always record the serial number.</p>

 	<section class="flex"> <!-- EPS AND BIKE THEFT-->
 		<div><h4>EPS and Bike Theft</h4></div>

 		<div>
 			<p>What should you do when you find an abandoned bicycle?<br>Thieves will sometimes make multiple trips in a night to steal multiple bikes, dumping them nearby until they can retrieve them later. If a bike suddenly appears near you, abandoned and with no owner around, you should immediately bring it some place secure. You can check to see if it’s been reported as stolen (see below), but if you find nothing, you can take it in to your nearest police station.</p>

 			<p>Is the price too good to be honest?<br>For a rough estimate, you can check <a href="https://www.bicyclebluebook.com/"> https://www.bicyclebluebook.com/ </a>to ballpark the used value of a bike, but keep in mind that even legitimate sellers may not necessarily always know the value of their own bike, especially lower-end or vintage bikes. For higher-end bikes, however, expect that a legitimate owner will know its value, understand its components, and be able to discuss specifics. A listing of a high-value bike for far less than it’s worth, where the seller doesn’t know or misspells the bike’s make, model, or components, is highly suspect. You can ask the seller for a photo of the bike’s serial number, but if it is actually stolen, the seller may simply ignore your or delete the listing, which can make recovery more difficult.</p>

 			<p>You can’t own a stolen bike<br>It is a criminal offence to be in possession of stolen property, if you know (or should have known) that the item was obtained by theft. If you purchase a stolen bike, at a minimum, if the proper owner of the bike spots it and claims it, the police may seize it from you to return to the owner, and you will receive no compensation for any money you paid to the thief.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div><h4>Reporting and Recovering a Stolen Bike</h4></div>

 		<div>
	 		<p>Report to Edmonton Police Service</p>	
	 		<p>If your bicycle has been stolen, and you hope to recover it from the police, you must <a href="https://www.coplogic.ca/dors/en/filing/submitreport?dynparam=1734157971192#prefilingQuestionsAnchor1"> file a report with the Edmonton Police Service online.</a></p>
	 		<p>You must be able to provide them with an exact description of the bike, including its serial number, for your best chance to recover it. If you don’t have a serial number, it can be challenging to identify your bike and prove your ownership.</p>
	 		<p>You must report your bike lost or stolen to the police. It is advisable that you record and report the serial number to aid in the potential recovery of the bike. The better the description you can provide the better the chance of recovery/identification.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div>
 			<p>Report to Campus Security</p>
 			<p>If your bike has been stolen on a campus, report it to the campus security services as well, as they can access campus security footage.</p>
 			<p>Police recover thousands of bikes a year, and run serial number matches against bikes reported stolen. If they find yours, and you’ve reported your bike stolen and provided a serial number, they’ll contact you. Otherwise, your bike will end up going to auction.</p>
 			<p>We hope not to ever see you visit this page to report your bicycle stolen. Prevention is always best–emotionally and financially–so lock your bike right!</p>
 		</div>

 		<div>
 			<p>Reporting to the Public</p>
 			<p>Reporting to EPS is important, but does not create a publicly shareable notice. To help people search for your bike and avoid buying stolen property, you should report it to <a href="https://bikeindex.org/">Bike Index</a> and/or<a href="https://project529.com/garage"> Project 529</a>. Both offer free online bike registry services. We recommend Bike Index, as it is open source and non-profit, and when a person searches for bikes on Project 529, any bikes registered on Bike Index will also appear in their search results. The reverse is not true: a person searching Bike Index will not see a bike registered only at Project 529.</p>
 			<p>When you report your bike as stolen on Bike Index, our local Twitter account @stolenbikesyeg will also automatically tweet the photos and info for your bike to the #yegbike hashtag to alert the community.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div>
 			<p>Sharing on Facebook</p>
 			<p>Share your bicycle details on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/576708895843716/"> Stolen Bikes Edmonton Facebook group.</a></p> 
 			<p>Places to search for your stolen bike</p>
 			<ul>
 				<li>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/576708895843716/">Stolen Bikes Edmonton Facebook group </a>includes many people watching out for suspicious used bike listings.</li>

 				<li><a href="https://ca.letgo.com/en">Letgo is a popular app for thieves to sell bikes</a></li>
 			</ul>

 			<p>If you find your bike listed on any online classified, avoid contacting the seller or reporting the listing as stolen, as these actions can spook the thief and cause them to hide. Rather, take screenshots, record all the seller’s information, including contact info and other items for sale, and contact the police with your original police report file number to let them know. Their online fraud unit will assist in recovering your bike.</p>

 			<p>Area pawn shops. Pawn shops are required by law to check the serial numbers of any goods they receive against the CPIC database. If there was a mistake in recording the serial number, or the wrong number was accidentally identified and search, or you weren’t able to report the serial number to the police, a pawn shop could honestly miss flagging the bike as stolen. If that is the case, if you find the bike in the pawn shop and can demonstrate ownership of the bike to the police, you are entitled to the bike, without having to pay the pawn shop.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div>
 			<p>Viewing Police Recovered Bicycles</p>
 			<p>If you have a good description of the bicycle, you can<a href="https://www.edmontonpolice.ca/CommunityPolicing/PersonalPropertyCrimes/PropertyExhibits/StolenBicycles.aspx"> contact EPS</a> to check if the bike has been recovered. Call the Property & Exhibits Unit at 780-421-2158 and EPS staff will check to see if your bike is in their inventory. The facility is a secure facility, meaning access to the general public is not permitted. If you have reported/know a complete detailed description of your bike, there is no need to attend as EPS staff can query their database using a variety of methods. At very least you should be able to provide the make, model, distinguishing marks/engravings (distinguishable meaning unique to that individual bike, not a group of bikes).</p>
 		</div>

 		<div>
 			<p>Police Bicycle Auctions</p>
 			<p>Police bike auctions are last resort to find your bike (or simply find a replacement). Bikes that have been recovered by the Edmonton Police, but haven’t been claimed, end up at police auctions. Bicycle auctions are held at Michener Allen Auctioneering, 11130 Bevington Rd, Acheson, AB (outside of Edmonton). Information on dates/times of auctions/viewing can be obtained by calling Michener Allen Auctions directly at 780-470-5584.<br><a href="https://www.maauctions.com/">View details online on the Michener Allen Auctions website.</a></p>

 			<p>History</p>
 			<p>The expansion of the Bikes on Buses Program in 2002 was made possible by the generous donation of 23 bicycle racks from Bike Edmonton (then known as the Edmonton Bicycle Commuters Society [EBC]). Alberta Ecotrust, Environment Canada and Health Canada provided funding to EBC. This provided ETS with an excellent opportunity to expand the Bikes on Buses to a good east/west connection for cyclists - Routes 1 and 4. The Bikes on Buses program started on the Route 9 in 1996, which provides a good north/south connection for cyclists. The program was initiated with assistance from Councillor Tooker Gomberg.</p>
 			<p>The Bikes on Buses project has been made possible by the hard work of:</p>
 			<ul>
 				<li>Edmonton Bicycle Commuters Society (EBC) staff and volunteers</li>
 				<li>the generosity of Alberta Ecotrust, for the purchase of bike racks</li>
 				<li>the City of Edmonton Transportation and Streets Department, Edmonton Transit Branch, for the suggestion, the in kind contributions, the donation of prompts (example, bus tickets), installation of the racks and the advertising campaign</li>
 				<li>Community Animation Program (CAP) grant, for funding of community based promotional activities</li>

 			<h4>What are Ghost Bikes?</h4>

 			<p>Ghost Bikes, bicycles painted all-white and placed at the site where a person riding a bike has been killed, are small and somber memorials for people killed by automobiles. The  installations are meant as reminders of the tragedy that took place, and as quiet statements in support of the right of all people to safe  travel.</p>

 		<div><h4>List of Ghost Bikes in Edmonton</h4></div>

 		<p>Bike Edmonton created and installed three Ghost Bikes in 2007, starting in September when two city cyclists were killed within days of each other. A third Ghost Bike was installed following a fatal accident in early December 2007.</p>

 		<ol>
 			<li>The city’s first Ghost Bike was placed on Stony Plain Road just west of Anthony Henday Drive to remember William Korol, 38, of Stony Plain, who died after being killed in a hit-and-run in the early morning of Saturday, September 15, 2007.</li>
			<li>A second Ghost Bike was placed three days later at 71st Street and 34th Avenue in Millwoods after 16-year-old Mathew Bensalah was killed cycling near his home at 9:30 pm on Monday, September 18, 2007.</li> 
			<li>The city’s third Ghost Bike memorial was placed at Princess Elizabeth Avenue near 102 Street after 55-year-old Adly Baskharoun was struck and killed just before 7:00 am on Saturday, December 8, 2007.</li>
			<li>On September 6, 2008 two more Ghost Bikes were erected in Edmonton. Edmonton’s fourth Ghost Bike was installed to remember Sandor Baracskay, 77, who died on Wednesday, September 3, 2008 after sustaining injuries after he was struck by a car on August 29 near 111 Avenue and Groat Road.</li>
			<li>Another Ghost Bike was installed at 110 Avenue and 153 Street after a September 5, 2008 collision where two cyclists were struck by a truck. William Boudreau, 43, died at the scene while the other cyclist suffered minor injuries.</li>
			<li>On October 5, 2008, a 15 year old boy was killed by a drunk driver on Dawson Bridge. A Ghost Bike was set up and remained, with the appreciation of family members.</li>
			<li>A Ghost Bike was placed at 156 St and Stony Plain Road after Ronnie Smith, 60, was struck on July 24, 2009, and died.</li>
			<li>On August 4, 2009, Dave Dupe, 35, was cycling along the Yellowhead Trail near 215 St when he was struck. A Ghost Bike was placed near the location.</li>
			<li>On April 20, 2010, Roman Cutillas, 49, a temporary foreign worker who rode a bike so he could send more money home to his family, was hit by a truck and killed near 126 St and 111 Ave. A Ghost Bike was placed.</li>
			<li>Jeremy Half, 29, was killed on November 12, 2010, while crossing 137 Ave at 131 St with a friend in a marked crosswalk. A Ghost Bike was placed at this location.</li>
			<li>On May 15, 2011, a 15-year-old cyclist was struck at 144 Ave and 54 St. He died in hospital on May 16.</li>
			<li>Isaak Kornelsen was killed on Whyte Ave near 102 St on August 27, 2012, after falling under the wheels of a passing cement truck. He was 21.</li>
			<li>On May 3, 2013, a 56-year-old man was hit by a pickup truck making a left turn from 107 Ave onto 127 St. He died on May 5.</li>
			<li>On May 22, 2014, Wendee Hockney, 50, was struck by a garbage truck as it made a right turn from 100 Ave onto 112 St. She died at the scene.</li>
			<li>On February 23, 2015, Christopher Beaulieu, 21, was struck from behind as he was cycling south of Edmonton. An experienced cyclist who always rode with bike lights, Christopher had left work in south Edmonton and was riding his fatbike on a 30-40km training ride for an upcoming summer tour. The temperature was about 7 degrees Celsius and conditions were clear. A Ghost Bike was placed on March 6.</li>
			<li>On May 20, 2016, a cyclist was struck at 6:30pm by a car as he was crossing Highway 14, just east of the Anthony Henday. He died at the scene.</li>
			<li>On November 5, 2017, a 38-year-old man was hit by a vehicle at 96 St and 111 Avenue. The driver of the vehicle fled the scene, and the man died in hospital a short time later.</li>
			<li>On January 4, 2021, a 64-year-old man was hit and killed by a crane truck and trailer when its driver turned right off 94B Ave onto 50 St.</li>
			<li>On August 27, 2022, a 53-year-old man was hit and killed while crossing Yellowhead Trail on the 50 St bike path when a driver on the Yellowhead off ramp struck him.</li>
 		</ol>

 		<p>On October 13, 2021, we also installed a ghost bike at 101 St and Kingsway Avenue, in memory of Ben Sauvé, a grade 12 student who was killed on October 5, 1987, while riding home after evening drama rehearsal at Victoria Composite High School. The bike was painted by Ben’s father, Clayton Sauvé, who held a small ceremony with friends.</p>

 		<p>We try to place Ghost Bikes nearest the scene of collisions, providing a visual cue for approaching motorists, asking them to slow down. We place Ghost Bikes to avoid blocking sight lines or sidewalks, but if you notice issues with a Ghost Bike, please feel free to contact us.</p>

 		<p>The first Ghost Bikes were created in St. Louis, Missouri in 2003, and they have since appeared in at least 30 cities throughout the world. More information on Ghost Bikes around the world is available at ghostbikes.org.</p>
